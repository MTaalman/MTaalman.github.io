        <h2>Study Motivation</h2>
        <p>Im currently studying HBO-ICT at HZ university of Applied Sciences. <br>
            My main motivation for the ICT programme is that im interested in app/game development and AI.<br>
            it also pays very well and its a good plan B to be honest if getting insanely rich doesn't work out.<br>

        <h2>My programming experience</h2>
        <p>I've had some experiences programming in C# in the unity engine.<br>
        I've created several small games and mods and went through some courses online.<br>
        I took a few hours of html courses aswell  and i can tell it helped me a great deal to get started in my first year.<br>
        i had some extra time to work on the things i didn't yet learn about, which was great, because the start of the year was very chaotic.
        </p>
        <h2>what i expect to learn in ICT</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>more coding languages and frameworks</li>
            <li>proffesional and personal development</li>
            <li>working in groups on projects with others</li>
            <li>better planning and a good work-life balance</li>
            </ul>
