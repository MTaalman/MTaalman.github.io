    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>My name is Michael, im 19 years old and i've lived in the Netherlands my whole life. <br>
        I currently live in middelburg after living in Vlissingen the past half year.<br>
        im a very energetic person generally, i dont like taking things too serious if its unnecessary. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
        My number one favorite thing to do is to make and listen to music. <br>
        when im not writing, making beats or looking for them online, im probably listening to music. <br>
        i used to play guitar since i was 9, but thats been a while. <br>
        i don't go to the gym, because who got that kind of money, but i do a lot of home-exercise and go out to stay in shape. <br>
        i like to spend my time around friends or go out with them. <br>
    </p>
