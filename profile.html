        <h2>My programming experience</h2>
        <p>I've had some experiences programming in C# in the unity engine.<br>
            I've created several small games and mods and went through some courses online.<br>
            I took a few hours of html courses aswell and i can tell it helped me a great deal to get started in my
            first
            year.<br>
            i had some extra time to work on the things i didn't yet learn about, which was great, because the start of
            the
            year was very chaotic.

        <h2>Study Motivation</h2>
        <p>Im currently studying HBO-ICT at HZ university of Applied Sciences. <br>
            My main motivation for the ICT programme is that im interested in app/game development and AI.<br>
            it also pays very well and its a good plan B to be honest if getting insanely rich doesn't work out.<br>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            My number one favorite thing to do is to make and listen to music.<br>
            when im not writing, making beats or looking for them online, im probably listening to music.<br>
            i used to play guitar since i was 9, but thats been a while.<br>
            i don't go to the gym, because thats expensive, but i do a lot of home-exercise and go out to stay in
            shape.<br>
            i like to spend my time around friends or go out with them.<br>
        </p>
