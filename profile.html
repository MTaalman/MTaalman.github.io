            Im a student at HZ univerity of Applied Sciences.<br>
            I currently live in middelburg after living in Vlissingen the past half year.<br>
            before that i lived in Philippine my whole life, a small town on the south side of Zeeland.<br>
            <br>
            I asked some friends, who might be biased, but they said some characteristics of mine were:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Im very relaxed.</li>
                <li>People feel at ease around me quickly.</li>
                <li>Considerate</li>
                <li>Progressive</li>
                <li>A life enjoyer</li>
                <li>I use google in light mode.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>My programming experience</h2>
        <p>I've had some experiences programming in C# in the unity engine.<br>
            I've created several small games and mods and went through some courses online.<br>
            I took a few hours of html courses aswell and i can tell it helped me a great deal to get started in my
            first
            year.<br>
            i had some extra time to work on the things i didn't yet learn about, which was great, because the start of
            the
            year was very chaotic.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            My number one favorite thing to do is to make and listen to music.<br>
            When im not writing, making beats or looking for them online, im probably listening to music.<br>
            I used to play guitar since i was 9, but thats been a while.<br>
            I don't go to the gym, because thats expensive, but i do a lot of home-exercise and go out to stay in
            shape.<br>I like to spend my time around friends or go out with them.<br>
            I enjoy playing games from time to time. but they make me feel like im wasting my time so not too much.<br>
            Me and my friend also have the luxury to have our trusted coffeeshops around the corner if we need to kill some time.<br>
            Thats just our Dutch roots i guess.<br>
